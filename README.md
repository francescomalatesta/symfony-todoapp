todoAppSymfony
==============

This is a very basic test application that I wrote to do practice with Symfony.

The idea is very simple: a todo application that includes many of the framework's features.

Every day I will implement something new, following a roadmap that I will plan day by day.

## Day 1

* Simple routing, sometimes with params;
* Doctrine basics;
* Authentication system;
* Twig templating;
* Fixtures;

## Day 2

* Flash messages support, to notify the user about what is happening;
* Optimizing templates, with includes and inheritance;
* Basic validation, using annotations;
* Implementing a repository for Tasks;
* Filter tasks by status (done, undone, all);
